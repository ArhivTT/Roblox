    <p>Roblox (pronunciation: [ˈroʊblɒks]) is an online gaming platform and game creation system that allows any user to create their own [⇨] and play games created by others[⇨], covering a wide range of genres[6]. In some sources, Roblox is called a metaverse[7][8]. As of August 2020, Roblox has more than 164 million monthly active users[9]; as of October 2021, more than 226 million[10]. All of them, in total, played more than 107 billion hours in it[11]. Moreover, more than half of all US children under the age of 16 play Roblox[12][13]. The growth of its popularity began in the second half of 2010[14], and accelerated sharply due to the COVID-19 pandemic[15]. The site of the gaming platform is the second most popular among teenagers, right after Google sites, including YouTube[6]. At the beginning of 2023, Roblox broke the world record for online, gaining 9.3 million active users[16].</p>
